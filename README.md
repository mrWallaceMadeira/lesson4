# Lesson 4: System.out.println("Printing and Strings");
Before we start on strings let's run it back to Friday.\
You might recall this&nbsp; :arrow_down:
  ```
  public class Main {
      public static void main (String [] args) {
        // write your code here
      }
  ```
A few things of note here
1. `public static void main` defines a Java method named main.
  - Think of a method like a collection of code that does similar things
  - The main method is _required_ to run a Java program
2. `public class Main` defines a Java class named Main
  - A class is a collection of similar methods.
  - You _do not_ need a class named Main.

:round_pushpin:&nbsp; It's not important to memorize or even remember any of this right now.  It will come with time.

### String basics
Let's construct an analogy.  Think of Java like English.\
English has nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc. English nouns are most similar to a **variable** in Java.

:question:&nbsp; What do nouns do?\
Describe things.\
:question:&nbsp; What do variables do?\
Describe things.

A tree is a noun, a **String** is a type of variable in Java.

### How do we use strings?
  1. **Declare** the string like this: `String myNewString;`
  2. **Assign** it a value like this: `myNewString = "Is J.Cole the greatest rapper alive?";`
  3. **Use it** like this `System.out.println(myNewString);

### What's the deal with printing?
Java provides us with standard **methods** to do common things like printing.\
One of those methods is `System.out.println`

### Comments: your own peanut gallery
Sometimes you need to leave yourself (or your friends) notes within your code.\
There are two ways to do this
  1. `// i am a one-line comment`
  2. 
  ```
    /**
      i am a multi-line comment. 
      We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, 
      insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare,
      and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, 
      do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of 
    **/ 
  ```
