# Lesson 4: System.out.println("Printing and Strings");
Before we start on strings let's run it back to Friday.\
You might recall this&nbsp; :arrow_down:
  ```
  public class Main {
      public static void main (String [] args) {
        // write your code here
      }
  ```
  A few things of note here
   1.  `public static void main` defines a Java method named main.
   * Think of a method like a collection of code that does similar things
   * The main method is _required_ to run a Java program
   2.  `public class Main` defines a Java class named Main
    -  A class is a collection of similar. You _do not_ need a class named Main.
